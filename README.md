# Chat App
A chat application (similar to something like Teams) built using React, Tailwind CSS and Firebase.

Improvements to make:
- make search case insensitive (extra lowercase field required in firebase)
- improve search so it's searching whilst typing and not just after Enter
- improve GUI so there's no horizontal scrollbar
- make profile picture optional, and upload with default if not selected
- migrate framework from CRA to Vite
